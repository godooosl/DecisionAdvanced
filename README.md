# ChoiceForge

**Privacy-preserving decision-making platform on Zama FHEVM**

ChoiceForge enables private decision processes where choices, preferences, and decision criteria remain encrypted during evaluation. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform processes decision logic over encrypted inputs, revealing only final outcomes while keeping individual choices and reasoning private.

---

## Purpose

ChoiceForge addresses the challenge of collaborative decision-making where participants need to express preferences privately while ensuring fair, verifiable outcomes. Traditional decision systems expose individual preferences, leading to social pressure and strategic manipulation. ChoiceForge uses Zama FHEVM to enable homomorphic decision aggregationâ€”computing outcomes over encrypted preferences without revealing individual choices.

**Core Objective**: Enable transparent, fair decisions while maintaining absolute privacy of individual preferences and reasoning.

## Decision Process

### Decision Initialization

**Setup:**
1. Decision creator defines:
   - Decision question/context
   - Available options
   - Decision criteria (optional)
   - Participant list
   - Decision deadline
2. Smart contract deployed
3. FHE keys generated and distributed
4. Decision opened for participation

### Preference Submission

**How Participants Submit:**
1. Participant reviews decision context
2. Evaluates options (privately)
3. Encrypts preferences using FHE public key
4. Submits encrypted preferences to contract
5. Receives confirmation receipt

**Privacy:**
- Preferences encrypted before submission
- Stored as encrypted ciphertexts
- Not visible to other participants
- Not visible to decision creator
- Not visible to validators

### Decision Aggregation

**Homomorphic Processing:**
1. Smart contract receives all encrypted preferences
2. Aggregates preferences using FHE operations:
   ```solidity
   euint64 totalScore = TFHE.add(
       preference1, preference2, preference3, ...
   );
   ```
3. Computes encrypted outcome scores
4. Determines winning option (encrypted comparison)
5. Generates cryptographic proof

**Operations:**
- Weighted preference aggregation
- Multi-criteria evaluation
- Ranking computation
- Outcome determination

### Result Revelation

**Outcome Publication:**
1. Decision deadline passes
2. Threshold key holders decrypt results
3. Final outcome published on-chain
4. Cryptographic proof of correctness available
5. Individual preferences remain encrypted (permanent)

---

## Decision Types

### Simple Selection

**Binary Choice:**
- Two options (Option A vs Option B)
- Participants encrypt preference (0 or 1)
- Homomorphic aggregation
- Winner determined by majority

**Example**: Choose between two proposals

### Multi-Option Ranking

**Preference Ranking:**
- Multiple options ranked
- Encrypted ranking vectors
- Borda count or similar (homomorphic)
- Winner determined by aggregate ranking

**Example**: Rank 5 product features by importance

### Weighted Scoring

**Criteria-Based Evaluation:**
- Multiple criteria weighted
- Each option scored per criterion
- Encrypted scores aggregated
- Weighted total computed homomorphically

**Example**: Evaluate vendors on price, quality, service

### Consensus Building

**Iterative Refinement:**
- Multiple rounds of preference submission
- Preferences aggregated each round
- Feedback provided (aggregate statistics)
- Final decision after convergence

**Example**: Iterative refinement of proposal

## Technical Foundation

### Homomorphic Decision Logic

**Preference Aggregation:**
```solidity
euint64 aggregatePreferences(
    euint64[] encryptedPreferences,
    euint64[] weights
) internal view returns (euint64) {
    euint64 weightedSum = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < encryptedPreferences.length; i++) {
        euint64 weighted = TFHE.mul(
            encryptedPreferences[i],
            weights[i]
        );
        weightedSum = TFHE.add(weightedSum, weighted);
    }
    return weightedSum;
}
```

**Winner Selection:**
```solidity
function selectWinner(
    euint64[] encryptedScores
) internal view returns (uint256 winner) {
    euint64 maxScore = encryptedScores[0];
    uint256 winnerIndex = 0;
    
    for (uint i = 1; i < encryptedScores.length; i++) {
        if (TFHE.gt(encryptedScores[i], maxScore)) {
            maxScore = encryptedScores[i];
            winnerIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    return winnerIndex;
}
```

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
contract ChoiceForge {
    struct Decision {
        string question;
        string[] options;
        euint64[] encryptedScores;
        euint64[] encryptedPreferences;
        uint256 deadline;
        bool resolved;
        address creator;
    }
    
    function createDecision(
        string memory question,
        string[] memory options,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256 decisionId);
    
    function submitPreference(
        uint256 decisionId,
        bytes calldata encryptedPreference
    ) external;
    
    function aggregateDecision(uint256 decisionId) external;
    
    function revealOutcome(
        uint256 decisionId,
        bytes calldata decryptionKey
    ) external;
    
    function getOutcome(uint256 decisionId)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256 winningOption);
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: How private are my preferences if they're stored on-chain?**  
A: Preferences are encrypted with FHE before submission. Only encrypted ciphertexts are stored, and aggregation occurs over encrypted data. Your preferences are never revealed.

**Q: Can decision outcomes be manipulated?**  
A: No. Outcomes are computed using homomorphic operations that are cryptographically provable. The aggregation process is verifiable, preventing manipulation.

**Q: What if I change my mind?**  
A: Depending on decision settings, you may be able to update your preference before the deadline. Once the deadline passes, preferences are locked.

**Q: How do I verify decision fairness?**  
A: ChoiceForge generates cryptographic proofs that anyone can verify, ensuring the outcome correctly reflects encrypted preferences without revealing individual choices.

**Q: What happens if not everyone participates?**  
A: Decisions can proceed with partial participation, depending on configuration. Minimum participation thresholds can be set.
